# Hardware Control Surface for Vocal Line Library

The main idea of this project is researching and constructing a hardware control surface for a Vocal Line Library.

The code creates a user friendly interface through which, the user has the ability to easily control hardware components (fx. faders, encoders, buttons), while at the same time, the setup displays various data received from these components.

The working project can be seen below:
